Urban roads usually need to carry more vehicles and pedestrians, so they are wider and sometimes have more lanes and sidewalks. In addition, urban roads may have more complex traffic signs and signal systems to manage traffic flow. Rural roads usually have fewer vehicles, they may be narrower, and do not have complex traffic control systems. In addition, the design of rural roads may take more into account the local natural environment and terrain characteristics to reduce the impact on the environment.", "audio": "a3196"}
