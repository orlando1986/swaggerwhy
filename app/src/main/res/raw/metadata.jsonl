{"name": "凳子", "question_cn": "为什么凳子的设计（包括腿的数量和材料）对其稳定性至关重要？", "answer_cn": "凳子的稳定性取决于其设计，包括腿的数量、形状和材料。四条腿的设计可以保证凳子在平面上有四个接触点，这样在大多数情况下能够保持平衡。此外，材料的强度和重量分布也会影响凳子的稳定性。一个结实且均匀分布的材料可以防止凳子在承重时发生变形或翻倒，从而使我们坐得更安全、更舒适。", "question_en": "Why is the design of a stool, including the number and material of its legs, so important to its stability?", "answer_en": "The stability of a stool depends on its design, including the number, shape, and material of the legs. A four-leg design ensures that the stool has four points of contact with the surface, so that it can remain balanced in most situations. In addition, the strength of the material and the weight distribution will also affect the stability of the stool. A strong and evenly distributed material can prevent the stool from deforming or tipping over when bearing weight, making us sit safer and more comfortable.", "audio": "a237"}
{"name": "椅", "question_cn": "为什么木制椅子和铁制椅子的稳定性不同？", "answer_cn": "木制椅子和铁制椅子的稳定性不同，主要是因为木材和铁这两种材料的密度、硬度和弹性模量不同。木制椅子较轻，但在承受重量时可能会因为材料柔韧性而导致一定程度的形变，影响稳定性。而铁制椅子通常更重，结构更坚固，因而更稳定。此外，铁制椅子经过特殊设计，如焊接或铸造成一体的结构，可以进一步提高稳定性。", "question_en": "Why do wooden chairs and iron chairs have different stability?", "answer_en": "The difference in stability between wooden and iron chairs is mainly due to the different density, hardness and elastic modulus of wood and iron. Wooden chairs are lighter, but may deform to a certain extent when bearing weight due to the flexibility of the material, affecting stability. Iron chairs are usually heavier and have a stronger structure, making them more stable. In addition, iron chairs are specially designed, such as welded or cast into a one-piece structure, which can further improve stability.", "audio": "a1570"}

{"name": "电话机", "question_cn": "电话的电信号是如何在不同地点之间传输的？", "answer_cn": "电话的电信号在不同地点之间的传输依赖于复杂的通信网络。当话筒将声音转换为电信号后，这些信号会通过电话线、光纤或无线电波传输。在有线通信中，电信号通过电话线或光纤电缆直接传输；在无线通信中，信号会被发送到最近的电话交换站，然后通过一系列的基站传输到目的地。电话交换站负责将信号路由到正确的接收者，整个传输过程中，信号可能会经过多个交换站和传输媒介，最终到达接收方的电话听筒。", "question_en": "How are telephone signals transmitted between locations?", "answer_en": "The transmission of telephone signals from one location to another relies on a complex communications network. After the microphone converts sound into electrical signals, these signals are transmitted through telephone wires, optical fibers, or radio waves. In wired communications, electrical signals are transmitted directly through telephone wires or fiber-optic cables; in wireless communications, signals are sent to the nearest telephone exchange and then transmitted to the destination through a series of base stations. The telephone exchange is responsible for routing the signal to the correct recipient, and the signal may pass through multiple exchanges and transmission media before finally reaching the recipient's telephone handset.", "audio": "a2243"}

{"name": "烤箱", "question_cn": "烤箱是如何产生热量的？", "answer_cn": "烤箱产生热量的主要原理是通过电加热元件，当电流通过这些加热元件时，会产生电阻热，使烤箱内部温度升高。在传统的电烤箱中，加热元件通常位于烤箱的顶部和底部，通过这些元件的加热，烤箱内部温度可以均匀地升高，从而对食物进行烹饪。而一些高级的烤箱可能采用风扇辅助循环热空气，以确保烤箱内温度更加均匀。", "question_en": "How does an oven generate heat?", "answer_en": "The main principle of generating heat in the oven is through electric heating elements. When the current passes through these heating elements, it generates resistance heat, which raises the temperature inside the oven. In traditional electric ovens, the heating elements are usually located at the top and bottom of the oven. Through the heating of these elements, the temperature inside the oven can be evenly raised, thereby cooking the food. Some advanced ovens may use fans to help circulate hot air to ensure a more uniform temperature inside the oven.", "audio": "a2011"}

{"name": "电灶", "question_cn": "电灶是如何将电能转化为热能，让食物烹饪的呢？", "answer_cn": "电灶通过内部的电阻丝来转化电能为热能。当电流通过电阻丝时，电阻丝因为电阻的存在会发热，这个热量被用来加热电灶上的烹饪器具，进而加热食物。这个过程基于焦耳定律，即电流通过导体时会产生热量的现象。电灶的设计使得热能可以有效地传递到烹饪器具上，从而实现烹饪的目的。", "question_en": "How do electric stoves convert electrical energy into heat energy to cook food?", "answer_en": "Electric stoves convert electrical energy into heat energy through internal resistance wires. When current passes through the resistance wire, the resistance wire will heat up due to the existence of resistance. This heat is used to heat the cooking utensils on the electric stove, and then heat the food. This process is based on Joule's law, that is, the phenomenon that heat is generated when current passes through a conductor. The design of the electric stove allows heat energy to be effectively transferred to the cooking utensils, thereby achieving the purpose of cooking.", "audio": "a2231"}

For example, placing clothespins on the shoulders or edges of the clothes can prevent the clothes from stretching and deforming due to gravity. The correct drying method not only protects the fibers of the clothes from damage, but also allows the clothes to maintain their original texture and color for a longer period of time.", "audio": "a1343"}
{"name": "basket", "question_cn": "How are baskets made?", "answer_cn": "Baskets are made through a process called basket weaving, which involves interlacing materials such as straw, bamboo, reeds, or synthetic fibers to create a sturdy container. The process begins with selecting the appropriate materials and preparing them by soaking or treating to make them pliable. The weaver then creates a base, often starting with a circular or rectangular shape, and weaves the materials in and out to form the sides of the basket. The weaving pattern can vary, resulting in different textures and designs. Finally, the top edge of the basket is finished with a border or handle to provide structure and functionality. The craftsmanship and techniques used in basket weaving can vary widely depending on cultural traditions and the specific purpose of the basket.", "question_en": "How are baskets made?", "answer_en": "Baskets are made through a process called basket weaving, which involves interlacing materials such as straw, bamboo, reeds, or synthetic fibers to create a sturdy container.

{"name": "碟子", "question_cn": "为什么陶瓷碟子比塑料或者玻璃碟子更能保持食物的温度？", "answer_cn": "陶瓷材料具有较好的保温性能，这是因为陶瓷的热容量大，导热性相对较低。当陶瓷碟子装载热食物时，它能够吸收并储存热量，从而较慢地释放出来，保持食物的温度。而塑料和玻璃的导热性较高，热量会更快地散失，因此保温效果不如陶瓷碟子好。", "question_en": "Why do ceramic plates keep food warmer than plastic or glass plates?", "answer_en": "Ceramic materials have good heat preservation properties because ceramics have a large heat capacity and relatively low thermal conductivity. When a ceramic dish is loaded with hot food, it can absorb and store heat, which is released more slowly to keep the food warm. Plastic and glass have higher thermal conductivity and will dissipate heat more quickly, so the heat preservation effect is not as good as ceramic dishes.", "audio": "a2371"}
{"name": "折纸工艺品", "question_cn": "制作折纸工艺品需要哪些基本技巧和材料呢？", "answer_cn": "制作折纸工艺品通常需要以下基本技巧：折、叠、翻、粘等。而材料方面，一般使用较厚的彩色纸，如彩色的卡纸，因为它不易皱且能保持形状。此外，有时还会用到剪刀、胶水等辅助工具来帮助完成复杂的折纸作品。通过这些基本技巧和材料，我们可以创造出各种精美的折纸艺术品。", "question_en": "What basic skills and materials are needed to make origami crafts?", "answer_en": "Making origami crafts usually requires the following basic skills: folding, stacking, turning, gluing, etc. As for materials, thicker colored paper is generally used, such as colored cardboard, because it is not easy to wrinkle and can maintain its shape. In addition, auxiliary tools such as scissors and glue are sometimes used to help complete complex origami works. With these basic skills and materials, we can create a variety of exquisite origami artworks.", "audio": "a1105"}
{"name": "家门", "question_cn": "家门除了保护我们的家不被坏人进入，还有什么其他的作用吗？", "answer_cn": "家门不仅是一位守护者，保护我们的家不被坏人进入，它还有很多其他的作用。比如，家门可以保温，防止室内的热量流失；它可以隔音，让家变得更加安静；家门还可以起到装饰作用，反映家庭的个性和风格。此外，一些家门设计有通风功能，保证了室内空气的流通。", "question_en": "In addition to protecting our homes from bad people, what other functions does the door have?", "answer_en": "The door is not only a guardian, protecting our home from bad people, but also has many other functions. For example, the door can keep the heat in and prevent the heat loss in the room; it can be soundproof and make the home quieter; the door can also play a decorative role, reflecting the personality and style of the family. In addition, some doors are designed with ventilation function to ensure the circulation of indoor air.", "audio": "a799"}
